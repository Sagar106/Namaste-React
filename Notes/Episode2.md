What is npm?

- It is a package manager for javascript runtime environment

Initialization - npm init

✅ What is a Bundler?
A bundler is a tool that takes your project’s code (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and bundles them into optimized files for the browser to load efficiently.

Think of it like a "compiler for web apps." Instead of having dozens or hundreds of separate files, a bundler combines them into one or a few optimized files for faster delivery to users.

📦 Why do we need a Bundler?
Modern JavaScript uses modules (import/export).

Browsers can’t load modern module code efficiently without processing.

You don’t want to manually handle dozens of .js, .css, .png, .svg, etc. files.

Bundlers:

Combine files (modules → bundles)

Optimize/minify code

Handle advanced features like tree-shaking, code splitting

Support advanced file types (e.g., .jsx, .ts)

⚙️ Example Bundlers
Bundler	Features	Used by (examples)
Webpack	Most powerful and configurable	React, Angular, Vue apps
Parcel	Zero-config, beginner-friendly	Small/medium JS apps
Vite	Modern, fast, ES modules, dev server	Modern React/Vue apps
Rollup	Great for libraries, tree-shaking	Libraries like React itself
esbuild	Extremely fast, modern bundler	Performance-first builds

📁 How it works (simplified):
You write code like:

import _ from 'lodash';
import { greet } from './greet.js';

console.log(greet('Sagar'));
Bundler runs → generates bundle.js:

(()=>{ /* All lodash code */ })();
(()=>{ /* Your greet code */ })();
console.log("Hello Sagar!");
✅ Browser loads 1 or 2 files, not 100s → faster page loads.

🛠️ Common Tasks Bundlers Handle:
Task	Example
Module bundling	Combining JS files
Transpilation	Convert JSX/TS to JS (via Babel, TypeScript)
Minification	Remove spaces/comments, shorten code
Tree shaking	Remove unused code
Code splitting	Load parts of code on demand
Asset handling	Bundle CSS, images, fonts, etc.

⚡ Example in React:
When you use Create React App (CRA) or Vite, they use Webpack or Vite under the hood to bundle your React code.

✅ Summary:
Bundler = Tool that takes all your project files → processes & combines → produces efficient, browser-ready bundles.

✅ 1️⃣ package.json
📌 What is it?
The manifest of your project. The configuration for npm.

Contains metadata about your project and lists the dependencies you (as a developer) specify.

🗂 Includes:
Project name, version, description, scripts

Dependencies (required for your app)

DevDependencies (used only in development)

Other metadata (author, license, etc.)

📦 Example:

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

⚙️ Purpose:
You manually maintain this file.

Defines what packages your app needs.

Used by developers and deployment tools to install dependencies.

✅ 2️⃣ package-lock.json
📌 What is it?
Auto-generated file by npm.

"Lock" file that records the exact versions of every installed dependency and their sub-dependencies.

Ensures consistent installations across different machines/environments.

🗂 Includes:
Exact versions of each package

Resolved URLs (from where they were downloaded)

Dependency tree structure

📦 Example (partial):

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "lockfileVersion": 3,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.18.2",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-..."
    }
  }
}
⚙️ Purpose:
Ensures reproducible builds → same dependencies, same versions for everyone.

Helps with security by locking dependency trees.

Used by npm/yarn to optimize installation speed.


✅ What is node_modules?
node_modules is the directory (folder) where npm (Node Package Manager) installs all the dependencies (libraries/packages) required for your project.

It’s like:

📦 “A storage folder for all the code your project depends on to work.”

⚙️ Where does it come from?
When you run:

bash

npm install
or

bash

npm install express
→ npm creates a folder called node_modules (if not already present) and downloads the required packages into it.

📁 Example Folder Structure:
perl
Copy
Edit
my-project/
├── package.json        # Metadata and direct dependencies
├── package-lock.json   # Lockfile for versions
└── node_modules/       # ⬅️ All installed dependencies (and their dependencies)
    ├── express/
    ├── react/
    ├── lodash/
    └── ...
📦 What’s inside node_modules?
Direct dependencies → Packages you explicitly installed.

Transitive dependencies → Packages your dependencies need.

Nested folders → Sometimes, dependencies of dependencies are inside their own node_modules folders to avoid version conflicts.

❗ Why is node_modules so large?
Because each package may depend on dozens or hundreds of other packages.

Many small utilities get reused across packages.

Packages can have their own node_modules inside them if version conflicts exist → This is called nested dependencies.

✅ Should you push node_modules to GitHub?
❌ NO.

node_modules should NEVER be pushed to version control.

Why? → It’s huge, redundant, and fully reproducible from package.json + package-lock.json.

Solution → Use .gitignore:

node_modules/
⚡ Regenerating node_modules:
→ If deleted:

bash
npm install
or

bash
yarn install
→ Re-creates it using package-lock.json or yarn.lock.

📌 Why do we need it?
When your app runs (node app.js), Node looks into node_modules to find the code it needs to run.

Without node_modules, your app won’t work unless everything is globally installed (not recommended).

✅ What are Transitive Dependencies?
Transitive dependencies are the dependencies of your dependencies.

📌 In simple terms:
Direct dependencies → Packages you install and list in package.json.

Transitive dependencies → Other packages that your installed packages need to work.

Think of it like:

You → need Library A → but Library A → needs Library B → B is a transitive dependency.

📦 Example:
Let’s say you run:

bash

npm install express
→ express is your direct dependency.

But Express internally needs:

accepts

body-parser

mime-types

etc.

➡️ Those are transitive dependencies for your project.

🛠 Visual Diagram:
scss
Copy
Edit
Your Project (package.json)
├── express (direct dependency)
    ├── accepts (transitive)
    ├── body-parser (transitive)
    └── mime-types (transitive)
⚡ Why is this important?
You didn’t explicitly install transitive dependencies → npm/yarn resolved them automatically.

Security → Vulnerabilities often hide in transitive dependencies.

Conflicts → Different libraries may require different versions of the same transitive dependency → → node_modules tree can get complex.

package-lock.json → Tracks the entire dependency tree (including transitive dependencies) to keep installs predictable.

📌 Real-life analogy:
You buy a smartphone (direct dependency) → It needs a SIM card (transitive dependency) → SIM needs network towers to work (further transitive dependencies).


✅ What is Parcel?
Parcel is a web application bundler. It takes your code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) and bundles it into a form that browsers can run efficiently.

Think of it like a "tool that prepares your web project to be shipped."

📦 Why use Parcel?
Modern web projects use modules, JSX, TypeScript, SCSS, etc., which browsers can’t always run natively. Parcel handles all that for you automatically.

⚙️ Features of Parcel:
